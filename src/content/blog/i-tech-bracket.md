I wanted to fix my i-tech USB hub to the bottom of my desk. I designed this
bracket to do just that. The bracket is parametric and can be adjusted to fit
any square thing you want to fix to the bottom of your desk. You will need to
use 4 screws (and you can tweak the parameters just for that).

The model is designed to be printed without supports.
