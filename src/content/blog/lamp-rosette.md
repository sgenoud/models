My landlord hired by painter to paint the ceiling of my flat. They did not
remove ceiling lamps, so when we wanted to install a new lamp, but we could see
where the paint was not done.

So I designed this rosette to hide the bad paint job. Also, this allows me to
have more cable hidden (and therefore not cut it too short).

I also added two screw slits to fix the rosette to the ceiling. I configured it to
fit with the holes from the previous lamp.

I printed the rosette in white PLA, with tree supports. The supports were easy
to remove, and the rosette looks great.
