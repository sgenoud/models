This model has been created to keep some erasable pencils for my son (of the
brand Super Petit). But I made it generic enough so that it can be used for any
type of crayon.

Note that the design was originally thought of to be able to print it in place,
but printing the cover was not great. The cover snaps in easily if printed
separately as well (and it looks great as a two colors piece).
