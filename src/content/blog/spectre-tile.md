A friend of mine is into ceramics and pottery, and he asked me to help him
design a stamp to apply a spectre monotile pattern to his pieces. This is the
result.

The stamp can be configured for different sizes, with the side of the tile
configurable as well.

A system of lock and key is used to help the removal of the stamp from the
clay.
